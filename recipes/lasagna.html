    <li>sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add sausage, if using, and cook,
      stirring occasionally, until it's starting to brown but not yet crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is totally
      softened and translucent (without letting it brown), 8 to 10 minutes. Add tomato paste and continue to cook,
      stirring until the tomato paste has turned a deeper brick red color, tinting the oil and onions a fiery orange
      color, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Using your hands, crush the whole tomatoes into smaller, bite-size pieces and add them and the crushed tomatoes,
      stirring to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pot. Fill one of the tomato cans halfway with water and add
      it to the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato
      sauce has thickened and flavors have come together, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
